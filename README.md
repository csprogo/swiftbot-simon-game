# swiftbot-simon-game
A Java program that implements the simon game and is compatible with a swiftbot

In order to use the program you must

1. Make sure that WinSCP is downloaded onto your computer
2. Connect to your swiftbot through the app
3. Transfer the Main.java onto the swiftbot
4. Close WinSCP and now open up a terminal
5. Then SSH into your swiftbot and compile the program using { javac -cp .:SwiftBot-API-5.1.3.jar Main.java }
6. Then you can run it by doing { java -cp .:SwiftBot-API-5.1.3.jar Main } (right now it should only print stuff as the game is still being developed)
